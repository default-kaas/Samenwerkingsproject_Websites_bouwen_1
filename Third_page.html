        <p class="bold">On this webpage you can find a little bit of information you need to know in order to be successful in atWar.</p>
        <p class="text">- First of all, it's mandatory to know that the whole game is made by 2 people, Amok and Ivan. They're respectively responsible for programming, and web + design.<br>
        Therefor, it's easier to exploit bugs in the game by using scripts through Javascript. This can be done as the game creators are not yet experienced enough to solve this issue.<br>
        They are pretty inactive, which means they leave newly bugs behind, and there's barely any development to be seen. Keep that in mind playing the game, don't expect something well-polished.</p>
        <img src="Image/exploit.png"<br>
        <p class="text">- Secondly, it's important to use multiple tactics during the gameplay, as well as strategies and using the environment to your advantage.<br>
        Doing this is not easy. But you'll learn this over time, by gaining experience. For more information, visit the ''Tactics'' page on our website!</p>
        <img src="Image/tactics.jpg"<br>
        <p class="text">- Lastly, diplomacy. It's very important. Make alliances, and don't backstab, because you'll be getting it back.</p>
