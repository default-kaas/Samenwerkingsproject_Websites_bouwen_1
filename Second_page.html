        <h1 class="tactics">Tactics</h1>
        <p class="dik">atWar's basics are very easy to master. It's skills aren't.</p>
        <p class="dun"></p>
        <p>There are many tactics you can use to be the best. Here are a few:</p>
        <ul class="ul">
            <li>Don't just attack. Anticipate the player's next move and defend accordingly.</li>
            <li>Use all available resources and assets. Boats, planes, truck transports, this can make the difference.</li>
            <li>Combined warfare is key. Use bombers, infantries, tanks, air and sea transports.</li>
            <li>Be unpredictable. Use distraction. Make sure the enemy won't see your next move coming, make use of this advantage.</li>
            <li>Always keep an eye on the siege stats. If your attack is higher than his defense, you're good.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's hard to properly master and take advantage of these tactics.</p>
